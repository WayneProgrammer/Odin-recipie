        <p>Ahh.. the classic <em>cheese</em> pizza. When done right, nobody could go wrong with its bursting flavors of <strong>tomato</strong> and <strong>cheese</strong> on a nice dough. This recipe helps make you feel right at home with its comforting and inviting flavors, accompanied with its delicously soft, crust dough.</p>
