        <p>A classic taco is a flavorful handheld dish featuring seasoned meat—like beef, chicken, or pork—tucked into a warm corn or flour tortilla. It's topped with fresh ingredients like shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cheese, and a splash of salsa or lime, delivering a perfect bite of bold, zesty flavor.</p>
